        Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
        Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
        hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
        strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
        from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common
        ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of
        which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose
        development varies according to species; the only known groups without
        wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified
        forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has
        led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins,
        and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory
        systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species
        of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have
        further evolved for swimming. Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and
        constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are
        considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their
        closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of
        the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first
        appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to DNA evidence, modern
        birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Early to Late Cretaceous, and
        diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene
        extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all
        non-avian dinosaurs.[5] Many social species pass on knowledge across
        generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social,
        communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating
        in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and
        mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially
        (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding
        season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other
        species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many
        females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds
        produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual
        reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the
        parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after
        hatching. Many species of birds are economically important as food for
        human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated
        and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and
        feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets.
        Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds
        figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become
        extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more
        before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with
        extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational
        birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological
        kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material,
        breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from
        a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. As
        of 2022, 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which
        around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around
        65,000 are vertebrates—but it has been estimated there are around 7.77
        million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5
        micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex
        interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate
        food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. Most
        living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a
        bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes,
        containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids
        and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the
        chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted
        as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late
        Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the
        fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which
        began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all
        living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single
        common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago. Historically,
        Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl
        Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for
        animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
        expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the
        animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with
        Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered
        animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals
        relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which
        are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between
        taxa. Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food
        (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and
        wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs
        have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial
        and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have
        appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology
        and religion.
